Portable - vesion for universal apps
TouchLib (proj. name AppAnalytics) - silverlight

folder SharedSRC contains *.cs files which is shared between Universal and Silverlight version. Those files are added as references. 

Beware of editin UDIDGen instead of RTUDIDGen (for example) if you are in Portable project. These classes have equal names. I may change it later. 

#testing and #App1(WP8.0) are ready for testing, just set it as startup and run.
